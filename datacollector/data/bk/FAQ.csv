1,1,Are you official?,No
2,2,Then who are you?,"We are a group of dedicated volunteers who are curating the news coming from state bulletins, press releases and news houses. We extract the details, like patient relationship to other patient (to identify local and community transmissions), travel history and status. We never collect or expose any personally identifiable data regarding the patients."
3,2,Why does covid19india.org have more postive count than MoH?,MoHFW updates the data at a scheduled time and we update them based on State Press Bulletins and reliable news channels which could be more recent.
4,3,Why are you guys putting in time and resources to do this while not gaining a single penny from it?,Because it affects all of us. Today it's someone else who is getting infected. Tomorrow it will be us. We need to prevent the spread. We need to document the data so that people with knowledge are able to use this data to make informed decisions.
5,4,How is the data gathered for this project?,"We collect the details from state press releases, official government links and reputable news channels as source. Data is validated by a group of volunteers and published into a Google sheet and an API, which is available for all at api.covid19india.org. We would love it if you can use this data in the fight against this virus."
